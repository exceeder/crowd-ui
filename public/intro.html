<h3>Objectives</h3>
  <p>This web app provides a dynamic UI hub that can be simultaneously developed
    by a crowd of frontenders. It fully adheres to the four reactive principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Responsive</li>
    <li>Resilient</li>
    <li>Scalable</li>
    <li>Message driven</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>A responsive system</b> is quick to react to all users — under blue skies and grey skies — 
    in order to ensure a consistently positive user experience.</p>
  <p><b>A resilient system</b> applies proper design and architecture principles in order to ensure
    responsiveness under grey skies as well as blue.</p>
  <p><b>A scalable system</b> is easily upgraded on demand in order to ensure responsiveness under
    various load conditions.</p>
  <p><b>A message-driven</b> architecture is the foundation of Reactive applications. A message-driven
    application may be event-driven, actor-based, or a combination of the two.</p>

  <p>The main difference between messages and events is that messages are directed while events happen.
    Messages have a clear destination while events may be observed by zero or more (0-N) observers.<br/>

  <p>This node app allows to explore various aspects of fully reactive UI, without buy-in into any reactive
  frameworks. It is a learning tool not meant to be a framework to develop full stack production UI .</p>
